💡 Business Recommendations

  - Focus on high-performing body styles : SUVs and Hatchbacks contribute the highest share of total sales. Increasing inventory availability and marketing efforts for these body styles can help drive additional revenue.
  
  - Optimize pricing strategy : Although overall sales grew by 23.59%, the average car price declined by 0.79%. Reviewing discounting and pricing strategies can help improve profit margins while maintaining strong demand.
  
  - Leverage popular color preferences : Pale White and Black are the most preferred car colors. Prioritizing these colors in production and inventory planning can reduce stock holding time and improve sales efficiency.
  
  - Strengthen regional sales strategy : Dealer regions such as Austin, Greenville, and Scottsdale show strong sales performance. Targeted regional promotions and dealer-level incentives can maximize returns in these high-performing locations.
  
  - Expand top brand partnerships : Brands like Buick, Subaru, and Porsche contribute significantly to total sales. Strengthening partnerships and running focused promotional campaigns with these brands can further increase market share.
